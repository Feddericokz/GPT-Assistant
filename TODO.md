# TODO:
List of things I don't want to forget.

* Logs tab is very basic, it just prints everything, you cannot even configure a log level.
* Assistant panel on settings doesn't work with the apply flow. Anything you change in it follows its own rules. It should adhere to the regular apply flow.
* Assistant panel also is never updated when it should change, settings need to be closed and then re-opened.
